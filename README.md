<h3>Why did you use this idea?</h3>
<blockquote>I've always notcied in my household that as much as I wanted to recycle, it was difficult. The issue mainly had to do with the fact that a lot of the products we think are recycleable are not. Even if they have a symbol on the bottom of the container, they can ONLY be recycled under certain circumstances or the product is too toxic / contaminated.</blockquote>
