                    <h2 class="text-center">Why this concept?</h2>
                    <blockquote>
                        I was taking out the recycling at home, and it started to become more difficult to determine which items could be recycled or not.
                        It started to dawn on me that there is a lot of work to properly recycle an object. If you were to recycle a plastic jar of mayo,
                        it would not be able to be recycled unless the insides are completely clean and the label is taken off. That's why I have selected
                        this as an idea for a website.

                    <h2 class="text-center">Our Vision</h2>
                    <blockquoute>
                        The idea is to eventually have an app that would allow you to scan the barcode of the item or use AI to determine what it could possibly be.
                        You would then be given the following:

                        <ul>

                            <strong>Name</strong>

                            <li>Description</li>
                            <li>Material</li>
                            <li>How to reuse:</li>
                            <li>How to reduce:</li>
                            <li>How to recycle:</li>
                            <li>Disposal Method</li>
                            <li>EcoScore</li>
                        </ul>


                        An EcoScore would give you a calculation of how efficient the item is. These include:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Ease of environmental disposal</li>
                            <li>How it's produced</li>
                            <li>If the item is safe to your health</li>
                        </ol>
                        <blockquote>
                            The main objective is to give the user a 'snapshot' of the item's lifecycle. If a consumer was able to make a purchase based on these factors
                            as well as many others... people can make better choices on how to recycle.

                            What are you waiting for?
